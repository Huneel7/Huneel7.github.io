### Welcome! 

I'm Hun, I am a master student in Biostatistics at the Columbia Mailman School of Public Health.

My hometown is Busan in South Korea. I earned my BS from University of California, Davis (Shout out to Aggies) with a degree in statistics.

I am interested in pursuing my career in research and my research interest lies in causal inference and Bayesian inference. I am an inquisitive person motivated by faith, hope, love, and insight. I am also interested in mathematics, soccer, and the books of the Bible.
